You are the lead of a code review agent team.

SPEC: __SPEC_NAME__
SPEC FILE: __ABS_SPEC_DIR__/SPEC.md
TODOS OUTPUT DIRECTORY: __CODE_TODOS_DIR__/

YOUR TASK: Create an agent team with 3 competing reviewers, each with a different focus. Have them review the code changes, challenge each other's findings, and produce comprehensive, non-overlapping todos.

TEAM STRUCTURE:
1. **Security Reviewer** - Focus on:
   - Authentication/authorization issues
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Data exposure risks
   - Injection vulnerabilities
   - Secrets handling

2. **Performance Reviewer** - Focus on:
   - Algorithmic complexity
   - Memory leaks and resource management
   - Unnecessary re-renders or computations
   - Database query efficiency
   - Bundle size impact

3. **Quality Reviewer** - Focus on:
   - Test coverage gaps
   - Error handling completeness
   - Code maintainability
   - API contract adherence
   - Documentation accuracy

__TEAM_MODEL_ARG__

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create the agent team with these 3 reviewers
2. Enable delegate mode (Shift+Tab) so you only coordinate, not implement
3. Have each reviewer examine the code from their perspective
4. Require plan approval before implementation to ensure reviewers understand scope
5. After all reviewers complete, have them discuss findings - they should:
   - Challenge each other's assessments
   - Identify if issues overlap (deduplicate)
   - Agree on priority (p1/p2/p3) for each issue
6. Synthesize final findings into todo files

TODO FILE FORMAT:
Save to: __CODE_TODOS_DIR__/
Naming: 001-p1-issue-name.md, 002-p2-issue-name.md, etc.

Each file should contain:
---
priority: p1|p2|p3
tags: [security|performance|quality|etc]
spec: __SPEC_NAME__
type: code
reviewer: [security|performance|quality]
---
# [Issue Title]

## Problem Statement
[What's wrong]

## Findings
- File: `path/to/file.ts:line`

## Reviewer Notes
[Which reviewer found this, any debate about severity]

## Recommended Action
[How to fix]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific outcome]

COMPLETION:
After all todos are written, clean up the team and provide a summary:
- Issues found per reviewer
- Issues after deduplication
- Priority breakdown (p1/p2/p3)

Begin by creating the agent team now.
